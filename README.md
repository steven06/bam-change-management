"Change Management and Version Control" Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "Change Management and Version Control" collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). In this collection we talk about how to use Drupal in a team environment and how to deploy and manage a Drupal site. We also cover:

* How to use Git
* Command Line (CLI) basics
* How to use Features to deploy configuration between environments
* How to version control configuration and content

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
